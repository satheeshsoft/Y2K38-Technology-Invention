    <summary>loginTimer - World First Y2K38 Technology Invention - Software that automatically scans computer login date and time</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[
loginTimer is powerful software that automatically scans computer login times and secretly stores them for you
in a private text file, in addition to all users' login date, time, total logins each day/user, admin actions, login
behavior (local and remote) and saves them continuously, one by one, in a private log file. This makes it easy
for you to identify any suspicious activity on your computer and take appropriate action if necessary.
